# Puredux

Puredux is a lightweight MVI architecture framework in Swift.

## What's Puredux

Purderux is a minimal, yet poweful library that allows to build iOS application in a clean and consistent way.

- It's tiny and easy to use and understand
- It's modular. Allows to bring to a project only those depenencies that it really needs
- It's flexible enough to be as strict as you want

## Why Puredux

- Pure state and reducer without side effects
- Clean UI and Presentation layer
- No room for unexpected state mutations
- All async work under control
- Another level of testability with independent side effects

## Special features

### Pure state

Modelling app state as a codable struct allows to obtain persistance out of the box.

### Threading
Puredux tries to make as little load on the MainThread's queue as possible.
PureduxStore is threadsafe and performs dispatching and then reduces the state on a background queue.

By defaut, Puredux presenters would prepare views' props in background as well.

Puredux hides all async stuff under the hood, leaving only sync things on the surface. Making app layers thin, plain and testable as hell.
