/// EnvStoreFactory is an `ObservableObject` wrap around Puredux's StoreFactory to be used in SwiftUI view hierarchy via environmentObject injection
///
/// `EnvStoreFactory` is a factory for stores of different configuration:
/// - Root Store
/// - Scope Store
/// - Child Store
///
/// That are connected afterwards to the SwiftUI via `ViewWithStore`
///
/// These guys:
/// - `EnvStoreFactory`
/// - `PublishingStore`
/// - `PublishingStoreObject`
///
/// are SwiftUI-friendly counterparts for Puredux's
/// - `StoreFactory`
/// -  `Store`
/// - `StoreObject`
///
/// **Usage:**
///
/// ```swift
/// let factory = StoreFactory(
///     initialState: AppState(),
///     reducer: { state, action in state.reduce(action) }
/// )
///
/// let envFactory = EnvStoreFactory(factory)
