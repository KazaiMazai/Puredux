/// ViewWithStore connects its `ContentView`  to the store.
///
/// Every time we dispatch an action to the store, it triggers view update cycle.
/// `Props` are re-evalutated according to state deduplication rules.
/// `Content` is re-rendered when props change.
///
/// **Props Evaluation**
///
///  The typical flow is:
///
///  `State` -> `Props` -> `Content`.
///
///  It allows to optimize the `Props` evaluation by hoping to a global queue.
///
///  However, `Props` is an extra layer which is not required and can be skipped.
///  Making the flow more simple:
///
///  `State` -> `Content`.
///
/// **Important to note:**
///
/// Before using `ViewWithStore`, `EnvStoreFactory` should be injected on top of the view hierarchy via `ViewWithStoreFactory`.
///
/// **Usage:**
///
/// ```swift
/// let factory = StoreFactory(
///    initialState: AppState(),
///    reducer: { state, action in state.reduce(action) }
/// )
///
/// let envFactory = EnvStoreFactory(factory)
///
/// UIHostingController(
///     rootView: ViewWithStoreFactory(envFactory) {
///
///        ViewWithStore { state, dispatch in
///            FancyView(
///                title: state.title
///                onTap: { dispatch(TapAction()) }
